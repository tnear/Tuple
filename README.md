# Tuple

+ Tuple implementation using variadic templates
+ std::tuple should be used in practice. This is intended as an academic exercise
+ to get familiar with new C++11 and C++14 concepts (idea from C++ Templates, D. Vandevoorde)
+ Includes a few tests which extract elements from tuple using both head/tail and compile-time integral
